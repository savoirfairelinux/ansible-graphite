    # This is a hack because start-stop-daemon get a little confused
    # when we run this inside a container and "start-stop-daemon --start
    # --pidfile mypid --exec myexec --test" fails to correctly identify
    # that the process has been successfully started. The pid file is
    # correct. The little more relaxed --startas checks works.
